## History of JP Morgan Wealth Management - Dylan Jurgensen & Jesus Perez
### JP Morgan - An Evolving Giant in FinTech
<p>J.P. Morgan & Co. is a financial institution who specializes in investment banking, asset management, and private banking. They are a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co., who’s long standing history dates to 1799, starting as one of the very first financial institutions after the United States inception. Their biggest competitors in the wealth management field are Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Fidelity Investments, and Charles Schwab, just to name a few.</p> <p>J.P. Morgan uses many types of technology to conduct their business. Whether it be with their online banking tools and convenience services, automated advisors who handle clients’ brokerage accounts, or their three-year-old blockchain platform Onyx, this firm is using technology as an imperative resource in paving its way into the future of FinTech. We can consider this a FinTech company because J.P. Morgan is currently using many assets to develop software in order to help their clients manage their finances more efficiently on their online platforms.</p><p>J.P. Morgan is at the forefront of technology in the financial sector because of their massive capital and market space. Their online interface and mobile application consistently rank in the top three of US firms from J.D. Power and Associates. A challenge they face in the coming years come from their previously mentioned product, Onyx. Cryptocurrency is currently in a bear market, so J.P. Morgan is not where they would like to be at this time after launching Onyx in 2020. Their department is slightly understaffed and need an influx of new FinTech professionals in order to take it to the next level. However, J.P. Morgan is ahead of competitors such as Fidelity and Morgan Stanley who have done very little in their own FinTech spaces.</p>
